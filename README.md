# Portfolio
I am a dedicated Public Health Specialist with over 7 years of experience designing and implementing community health and nutrition programs. My mission has always been to improve lives using evidence-based strategies — and now, I’m enhancing that mission with technology.

Currently, I’m transitioning into a Data & AI Practitioner role, applying machine learning, data analytics, and interactive web apps to solve real-world problems — especially in public and preventive health.

Through hands-on projects like:

🛏️ ITN Usage Prediction App (malaria prevention analytics)
💳 Loan Defaulters Risk Model
🎬 Movie Recommendation System
I’ve built full-stack solutions using Python, Streamlit, and scikit-learn — and deployed them live for stakeholder use. I’ve also completed formal training in Data Science, Machine Learning, and Cybersecurity, and I’m currently advancing in Cloud Engineering to better manage scalable, secure, and data-driven systems.

I’m passionate about using AI and digital health solutions to improve lives — especially in low-resource settings — and I’m eager to collaborate on impactful projects in data, healthcare, tech-for-good, or global development.
